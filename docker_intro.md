## Features of Docker

- Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.

- With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.

- You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.

- Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.
